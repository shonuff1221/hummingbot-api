# PMM (Pure Market Making) Controller Documentation

## General Description

The PMM (Pure Market Making) controller implements a sophisticated market making strategy that continuously places buy and sell limit orders around the current market price to profit from the bid-ask spread. This controller uses dynamic position management with configurable inventory targets and risk controls to maintain balanced exposure while capturing spread profits.

**Core Strategy Mechanics**: The controller maintains multiple order levels on both sides of the order book, adjusting order sizes based on current inventory levels through a skew mechanism. When inventory deviates from the target position, the controller automatically adjusts order sizes to encourage rebalancing - increasing buy orders when below target and sell orders when above target.

**Optimal Market Conditions**:
- Stable, range-bound markets with consistent volatility
- High trading volume with good liquidity
- Markets with natural mean reversion tendencies
- Periods of low directional momentum

**Challenging Conditions**:
- Strong trending markets (risk of adverse selection)
- Extreme volatility spikes or flash crashes
- Low liquidity environments with wide spreads
- Markets experiencing structural breaks or regime changes

**Risk Profile**: Medium to high risk depending on configuration. Primary risks include inventory risk from accumulating positions during trends, adverse selection from informed traders, and execution risk from rapid price movements.

## Parameters

### `connector_name`
- **Type**: `str`
- **Default**: `"binance"`
- **Description**: The exchange connector to use for trading

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- Different exchanges have varying fee structures, liquidity profiles, and API latencies
- Perpetual connectors (e.g., `binance_perpetual`) enable leverage trading
- Spot connectors (e.g., `binance`) are for unleveraged trading

### `trading_pair`
- **Type**: `str`  
- **Default**: `"BTC-FDUSD"`
- **Description**: The trading pair to make markets on

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- Major pairs (BTC-USDT, ETH-USDT) typically have tighter spreads and higher competition
- Altcoin pairs may offer wider spreads but higher volatility risk
- Stablecoin pairs (USDC-USDT) have minimal directional risk but tiny spreads

### `portfolio_allocation`
- **Type**: `Decimal`
- **Default**: `0.05` (5%)
- **Range**: `[0.01, 1.0]`
- **Description**: Maximum percentage of total capital to allocate around mid-price

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- **Low Values** (`0.01-0.05`): Conservative exposure, suitable for testing or volatile markets
- **Medium Values** (`0.05-0.20`): Standard allocation for balanced risk/reward
- **High Values** (`0.20-1.0`): Aggressive allocation, higher profit potential but increased risk
- **Edge Cases**: Values above 0.5 may lead to insufficient reserves for rebalancing

#### Interaction Effects:
- Combines with `total_amount_quote` to determine actual order sizes
- Affects how quickly the bot can adjust to inventory imbalances

### `target_base_pct`
- **Type**: `Decimal`
- **Default**: `0.2` (20%)
- **Range**: `[0.0, 1.0]`
- **Description**: Target inventory level as percentage of total allocation

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- **Low Values** (`0.0-0.2`): Quote-heavy strategy, profits from upward price moves
- **Medium Values** (`0.3-0.7`): Balanced inventory, neutral market exposure
- **High Values** (`0.8-1.0`): Base-heavy strategy, profits from downward moves
- **Typical**: 0.5 for market-neutral approach

#### Interaction Effects:
- Works with `min_base_pct` and `max_base_pct` to define rebalancing boundaries
- Influences skew calculations for order sizing

### `min_base_pct` / `max_base_pct`
- **Type**: `Decimal`
- **Default**: `0.1` / `0.4`
- **Range**: `[0.0, 1.0]`
- **Description**: Inventory boundaries that trigger rebalancing behavior

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- **Tight Range** (`0.4-0.6`): Aggressive rebalancing, more frequent position adjustments
- **Medium Range** (`0.3-0.7`): Balanced approach, moderate rebalancing
- **Wide Range** (`0.1-0.9`): Tolerates large inventory swings, less rebalancing
- **Edge Cases**: Range too tight may cause excessive trading; too wide increases directional risk

#### Interaction Effects:
- When inventory hits boundaries, controller only places orders on one side
- Affects profitability in trending vs ranging markets

### `buy_spreads` / `sell_spreads`
- **Type**: `List[float]`
- **Default**: `[0.01, 0.02]`
- **Range**: `[0.0001, 0.10]` per spread
- **Description**: Distance from mid-price for each order level (as decimal percentage)

#### Value Impact Analysis:
- **Tight Spreads** (`0.0001-0.001`): 
  - More fills but smaller profit per trade
  - Higher risk of adverse selection
  - Suitable for liquid markets with low volatility
- **Medium Spreads** (`0.001-0.01`):
  - Balanced fill rate and profitability
  - Standard for most market conditions
- **Wide Spreads** (`0.01-0.10`):
  - Fewer fills but larger profit per trade
  - Better protection against adverse moves
  - Suitable for volatile or illiquid markets

## Performance Tuning Guide

### Key Parameters for Optimization

1. **Spread Parameters** (`buy_spreads`, `sell_spreads`)
   - Primary driver of profitability vs fill rate
   - Adjust based on market volatility and competition
   - Monitor fill rates and adjust if too high/low

2. **Inventory Management** (`target_base_pct`, `min/max_base_pct`, `max_skew`)
   - Controls directional exposure
   - Tighter ranges for ranging markets
   - Wider ranges for trending markets

3. **Timing Parameters** (`executor_refresh_time`, `cooldown_time`)
   - Balance between responsiveness and transaction costs
   - Shorter times for volatile markets
   - Longer times for stable conditions

### Market Condition Adjustments

**High Volatility**:
- Increase spreads by 2-5x
- Reduce portfolio allocation by 50%
- Increase cooldown time to 30-60s
- Tighten global stop loss

**Low Liquidity**:
- Increase spreads to capture wider bid-ask
- Reduce order sizes (lower portfolio allocation)
- Increase executor refresh time
- Use back-weighted amount distributions

**Trending Market**:
- Adjust target_base_pct in trend direction
- Widen min/max boundaries
- Reduce max_skew for stronger rebalancing
- Consider reducing leverage

**Range-Bound Market**:
- Tighten spreads for more fills
- Increase portfolio allocation
- Use balanced or front-weighted distributions
- Standard refresh times

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Not Filling
- **Check minimum order size** for the trading pair
- **Reduce spreads** to get closer to market price
- **Verify** market is active and liquid
- **Increase** portfolio allocation if orders too small

### Excessive Inventory Accumulation
- **Reduce** max_skew to increase rebalancing pressure
- **Tighten** min/max_base_pct range
- **Review** spreads - may be too aggressive on one side
- **Check** for trending market conditions

### High Drawdown
- **Reduce** leverage immediately
- **Tighten** global_stop_loss parameter
- **Decrease** portfolio_allocation
- **Widen** spreads for better entry prices
- **Increase** cooldown_time after losses

### Frequent Order Cancellations
- **Increase** executor_refresh_time
- **Check** for API rate limits
- **Verify** network connection stability
- **Consider** wider spreads

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 1-2% portfolio allocation and low/no leverage
2. **Paper Trade First**: Test configurations without real capital
3. **Monitor Actively**: Watch performance for first 24-48 hours of new config
4. **Gradual Scaling**: Increase allocation/leverage gradually as confidence builds
5. **Risk Limits**: Always set global stop loss and take profit levels
6. **Market Research**: Understand the specific dynamics of your chosen trading pair
7. **Regular Reviews**: Analyze performance weekly and adjust parameters
8. **Diversification**: Consider running multiple instances on different pairs
9. **Fee Awareness**: Account for trading fees in spread calculations
10. **Backup Plans**: Have exit strategy if market conditions change dramatically

## Additional Notes

- PMM works best in liquid markets with consistent two-way flow
- Avoid during major news events unless specifically configured for volatility
- Consider time-of-day effects (Asian/European/US sessions)
- Some exchanges have special maker fee rebates that improve profitability
- Always ensure sufficient balance for potential position accumulation
- The controller automatically handles position sizing based on available balance
- Monitor the skew visualization in status to understand rebalancing behavior
